## Package Overview

The Auth library is one of the standard library modules of the [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) language.

This module provides a framework for authentication/authorization with Basic authentication scheme as specified in [RFC 7617](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617).

The "Basic" Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) authentication scheme transmits credentials as user-id/password pairs, encoded using Base64. This scheme is not considered to be a secure method of user authentication unless used in conjunction with some external secure system such as TLS , as the user-id and password are passed over the network as cleartext.

The Ballerina Auth module facilitates auth providers that is to be used by the clients and listeners of different protocol connectors.
